# NBA-Player-Score-Prediction-User-Input-
Building an Linear Regression model for NBA Player Score Prediction (User Input)

# Description:
This repository implements a linear regression model to predict NBA player scores based on user-input features. The project showcases how traditional machine learning techniques can be applied to sports analytics, allowing users to estimate player performance based on key metrics like minutes played, field goal percentage, and assists.

# Features:
User Input Interface: Enables users to input player statistics and predict their performance.
Model Implementation: Uses linear regression to build a simple and interpretable model for score prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data for training and testing.
Evaluation: Measures model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Interactive Prediction: Allows users to test the model by entering custom values for player stats.
